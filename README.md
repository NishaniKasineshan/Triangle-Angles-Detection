# Triangle-Angles-Detection
This repo contains two python files from which you can find the angles of triangles automatically or using mouse clicks. Each method has their own pros and cons which can be improved. 
Both the detection methods contain their pros and cons
#Automatic Angle Detection
Well, the automatic angle detection will be able to detect angles of equilateral and isosceles triangle approximately but this method is not yet efficient for finding angles of scalene triangle.

#Mouseclick Angle Detector
This method is efficient so that based on the coordinate points taken from the mouse click events we will be able to calculate the angle between the points
 TODO: Currently it will be able to calculate only the angle between the points you click. But we can automate the method to display all the angles with the coordinates
